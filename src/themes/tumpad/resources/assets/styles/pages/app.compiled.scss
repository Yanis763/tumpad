// Files located in the `pages` folder will be automatically loaded
// based on the body classes generated by wordpress.

// "app" is always the first body class so this file will be loaded
// accross all front end pages

// --- Import npm dependencies ---
// Prefix your imports with `~` to grab from node_modules/
// @see https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#imports
// @import "~some-node-module";

// --- Bulma ---
// bulma should only be loaded in this file to avoid splitting it's
// imports across multiple compiled files. This is to avoid duplicating
// bulma's import by mistake. (it's imports are quite costly already)
@import "../vendors/bulma";

// --- Components ---
@import "../components/buttons";
@import "../components/forms";
@import "../components/sharer";
@import "../components/wp-classes";

// --- Layouts ---
@import "../layouts/footer";
